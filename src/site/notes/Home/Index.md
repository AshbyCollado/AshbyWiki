# Ashby's Wiki

This is wikia, my Obsidian vault intended as a compendium of all knowledge I have encountered and found interesting. Mainly as an Electrical Engineering curriculum assistance.

## About Me

I am currently a _electrical engineering_ university student interested in Power Engineering and Data Centers.

## About the vault

This vault was built with Obsidians' [Digital Garden community plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), hosted on [Netlify](netlify.com). _Most_ of the notes in this vault are _completely self-written_. The sources for any topic include Wikipedia, university resources, textbooks, and other books.
